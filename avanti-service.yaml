  description: |
    A example service for storing orders. It has an private end-point to upsert orders from an integration service. Sends an event when the order is stored in this service.

    This service is an example of being a generic service for a specific domain entity (order) where the entities are originating from outside
    the platform (via integration services). The order in this service gets an internal id, but holds a dictionary of external identifiers (so an order could also point to different systems)
