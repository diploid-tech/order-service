# Avanti Platform - Sample Order Service

A example service for storing orders. It has an private end-point to upsert orders from an integration service. Sends an event when the order is stored in this service.

This service is an example of being a generic service for a specific domain entity (order) where the entities are originating from outside the platform (via integration services). The order in this service gets an internal id, but holds a dictionary of external identifiers (so an order could also point to different systems)

## Prerequisites

- Windows / Linux / MacOS
- .NET 5 Runtime
- PostgreSQL 12 or higher

## Installation

```bash
dotnet restore
```

**For local development, some settings have to be set before the service can function. These settings are set using
environment variables. To start, copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and alter the file for your needs. Without this
step, the service will probably not work!**

## Starting the service

The service needs a datastore to store it's data. For local development, use a local PostgreSQL instance. Recommended to use the Docker version:

```bash
docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Passw0rd -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:12
```

It could also need a Azure Storage Account to store blobs and event support (if the service implements it). There is an open-source emulator available which can be started with:

```bash
docker run -d -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
```

The service can be started after PostgreSQL and Azurite are running and the '.env' is available. Start the service:

```bash
dotnet run -p ./src/Avanti.Service.OrderService/
```

### Starting a localhost cluster

Start the first service as described above (will start on port 2552 as default, see `avanti-service.yaml`). Open a second terminal and set the following:

```bash
export Main__HttpPort=5001
export Main__ClusterPort=2553
export AkkaSettings__ClusterDiscoveryResolver=EnvironmentVariables
export EnvVarsAkkaClusterSettings__ClusterSeeds=localhost:2552
```

Then start the service as above.

### Starting a cluster outside Kubernetes on multiple hosts

On each host, start the service using the following settings:

```bash
export AkkaSettings__ClusterDiscoveryResolver=EnvironmentVariables
export EnvVarsAkkaClusterSettings__UseHostIpAsPublic=true
export EnvVarsAkkaClusterSettings__ClusterSeeds=<OtherIP>:2552
```

Then start the service as above.

## Testing

```bash
dotnet test ./test/OrderServiceTests/
```

# API

This service has Swagger integration for querying available endpoints. The Swagger UI is available on `/swagger` of the HTTP port (5000) for the service.
